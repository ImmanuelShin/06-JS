# 06-JS

A further continuation of my 04-HTML and 05-CSS projects. This project is meant to demonstrate my familiarity with JavaScript. With that being said, this is my first time using JavaScript, so the features are quite sparse. The plan is to buff up my skills as time goes on. In the future, this project will serve as a comparison piece to my later, more developed, JavaScript skills. Hopefully.
